\subsection{Fundamentals of magnetic equivalent layer}
\label{subsec:mag_eqlayer}

%%% Continuous layer
Considering a Cartesian coordinate system with $x$-, $y$- and $z$-axis being oriented to north, east and downward, respectively. Let $\Delta T_i \equiv \Delta T (x_i,y_i,z_i)$ be the total field anomaly, at the $i$th position $(x_i,y_i,z_i)$, produced by a continuos layer located below the observation plane on the depth $z_c$, where $z_c > z_i$, and $p(x',y',z_c)$ is the distribution of magnetic dipoles per unit area over the layer surface. In this case, the total-field anomaly produced by a continuous layer is given by equation 

\begin{equation}
\Delta T_i = \int \limits_{-\infty}^{+\infty } \int \limits_{-\infty}^{+\infty }  p(x',y',z_c)  [\gamma_m \hat{\mathbf{F}}_0^T \mathbf{H}(x_i,y_i,z_i,x',y',z_c) \,\hat{\mathbf{h}}(\mathbf{q})] dx' \,dy',
\label{eq:continuous_layer}
\end{equation}
where $\gamma_m$ is a constant proportional to the vacuum permeability, $\hat{\mathbf{F}}_0$ is a unity vector with the same direction of the main geomagnetic field given by

\begin{equation}
	\hat{\mathbf{F}}_0 =
	\left[ \begin{array}{c}
		 \cos I \cos D \\
		 \cos I \sin D \\
		 \sin I     
	\end{array} \right] ,
	\label{eq:main_field}
\end{equation}
where $I$ and $D$ are the inclination and declination, respectively. The $\hat{\mathbf{h}}(\mathbf{q})$ is a unity vector with the magnetization direction of the layer given by 

\begin{equation}
	\hat{\mathbf{h}}(\mathbf{q}) =
	\left[ \begin{array}{c}
		\cos \tilde{\i} \cos \tilde{d} \\
		\cos \tilde{\i} \sin \tilde{d}\\
		\sin \tilde{\i}
	\end{array} \right] 
	\label{eq:mag_vec}
\end{equation}
and $\mathbf{q}$ is a $2 \times 1$ vector with components given by 

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{q} =
	\left[ \begin{array}{c}
		\tilde{\i} \\ 
		\tilde{d} 
	\end{array} \right] ,
	\label{eq:q_vector}
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{\i} $ and $\tilde{d} $ is the inclination and declination of magnetization of the layer, respectively. The $\mathbf{H}(x_i,y_i,z_i,x',y',z_c)$ is a $3 \times 3$ matrix equal to  
\begin{equation}
   \mathbf{H}(x_i,y_i,z_i,x',y',z_c) =
   \left[ \begin{array}{ccc}
   \partial_{xx} \phi & \partial_{xy} \phi &\partial_{xz} \phi \\  \partial_{yx} \phi & \partial_{yy} \phi &\partial_{yz} \phi \\  \partial_{zx} \phi &\partial_{zy}\phi  & \partial_{zz} \phi    
   \end{array} \right] ,
   \label{eq:H}
\end{equation}
where $\partial_{\alpha \beta} \phi$, $\alpha = x, y, z$ and $\beta = x, y, z$, is the second derivative of the scalar function 

\begin{equation}
   \phi (x_i,y_i,z_i,x',y',z_c) = \frac{1}{[(x_i-x')^2 + (y_i-y')^2 + (z_i-z_c)^2]^{\frac{1}{2}}} .
   \label{eq:phi}
 \end{equation}
with respect to the Cartesian coordinates $x_i$, $y_i$ and $z_i$ of the observation points.  


%%% Formulating the forward problem
\subsection{Forward problem}

However, in practical situations, its not possible to determine a continuous magnetic-moment distribution $p(x',y',z_c)$ over the layer as shown in equation \ref{eq:continuous_layer}. For this reason, the continuous equivalent layer have to be approximated  by a discrete set of $M$ dipoles with unit volume located at a constant depth $z = z_c$. Let $\mathbf{p}$ be an $M$-dimensional parameter vector, whose $j$th element $p_j$ is the magnetic intensity of the $j$th dipole and $\mathbf{q}$ be a vector containing the inclination $\tilde{i}$ and declination $\tilde{d}$ of all dipole, analogously to equation \ref{eq:q_vector}. Mathematically, by discretizing the integrand of equation \ref{eq:continuous_layer}, the total-field anomaly produced by equivalent layer at the point $(x_i,y_i,z_i)$ is given by     

\begin{equation}
\Delta T_i (\mathbf{p},\mathbf{q}) = \sum_{j=1}^{M} p_j g_{ij} (\mathbf{q})
\label{eq:tfa_pred_pos_i}
\end{equation}    
where 

\begin{equation}
g_{ij} (\mathbf{q})  = \gamma_m \hat{\mathbf{F}}_0^T \mathbf{H}_{ij} \hat{\mathbf{h}}(\mathbf{q})
\label{eq:g_ij}
\end{equation}
is an harmonic function representing the total-field anomaly produced at the $i$th position $(x_i,y_i,z_i)$ by a dipole located at $(x_j,y_j,z_c)$ with unitary magnetic-moment intensity. The matrix $\mathbf{H}_{ij}$ is formed by the second derivatives of a function $\phi_{ij}$ that depends on the inverse of the scalar function $r_{ij} = [(x_i-x_j)^2 + (y_i-y_j)^2 + (z_i-z_c)^2]^{1/2}$, analogously to equation \ref{eq:H} and \ref{eq:phi}. In matrix notation, the equation \ref{eq:tfa_pred_pos_i} can be represented as 

\begin{equation}
 \mathbf{\Delta T} (\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{q}) = \mathbf{G}(\mathbf{q}) \mathbf{p}
\label{eq:tfa_pred}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{G}(\mathbf{q})$ is an $N \times M$ matrix whose $ij$th element is defined by the harmonic function $g_{ij}(\mathbb{q})$ (equation \ref{eq:g_ij}) and $\mathbf{\Delta T} (\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{q})$ is an $N \times 1$ vector whose the $i$th element is the predicted total-field anomaly $\Delta T_i (\mathbf{p},\mathbf{q})$ (equation \ref{eq:tfa_pred_pos_i}). As can be noticed from equation \ref{eq:tfa_pred_pos_i}-\ref{eq:tfa_pred}, the predicted total-field anomaly produced by equivalent layer has a linear relation with the magnetic moment $\mathbf{p}$ and a nonlinear relation with the magnetization direction $\mathbf{q}$. 

\subsection{Iterative process for magnetization estimation}

%%% Defining the objective function

Let $\mathbf{\Delta T}^o$ be an \textit{N}-dimensional vector whose $i$th element $\Delta T_i^o$ is the total field anomaly observation produced by a magnetic source at the point $(x_i,y_i,z_i)$, $i = 1, \ldots, N$. The estimation of the magnetic moments $\mathbf{p}$ and the magnetization direction $\mathbf{q}$ consists to formulate an inverse problem by imposing a positivity constraint on the magnetic-moment distribution. It can be performed by minimizing the difference between the observed data $\mathbf{\Delta T}^o$ and the predicted data $\Delta T (\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{q})$ (equation \ref{eq:tfa_pred}) by imposing a positivity constraint.

In other words, a stable estimates $\mathbf{p}^\sharp$ and $\mathbf{q}^\sharp$ can be obtained by minimizing the objective function given by

\begin{equation}
\Psi(\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{q}) =  \parallel \mathbf{\Delta T}^o - \mathbf{\Delta T} (\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{q}) \parallel_{2}^{2},
\label{eq:misfit}
\end{equation}
where $\Psi(\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{q})$ is the data misfit, which is the Euclidean norm of the difference between the $\mathbf{\Delta T}^o$ and $\mathbf{\Delta T} (\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{q})$.

%%% Explaining the iterative process

The procedure of finding a set of magnetic moment $\mathbf{p}^\sharp$ and magnetization direction $\mathbf{q}^\sharp$ which minimize the equation \ref{eq:misfit} consists to solve an inverse problem for estimating a set of parameters in two steps. Therefore, we split the inverse problem in a mixed solution of two systems of equations. The first one solves a linear system for estimating the part of the magnetic moment. Secondly, the problem is solved through a non-linear process to calculate successive approximations for the part of the magnetization direction at each iteration along the process. 

However, at the $k$th iteration, we impose positivity constraint on the magnetic-moment distribution estimate $\mathbf{p}^k$ by solving the following constrained problem of

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		& \text{minimizing}
		& &\lVert \Delta \mathbf{T}^o - \mathbf{G}(\mathbf{q}_{k-1}) \mathbf{p}^k \rVert_{2}^{2} \\
		& \text{subject to}
		& & \mathbf{p}^k \geqslant 0
	\end{aligned}
	\label{eq:positivity}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{G}(\mathbf{q}_{k-1})$ is the $N \times M$ matrix defined in equation \ref{eq:tfa_pred},
$\| \cdot \|_{2}^{2}$ represents the squared Euclidean norm and $\mathbf{p}^k \geqslant 0$ means that the magnetic moments of all equivalent sources are positive. This problem is solved by using the nonnegative least squares (NNLS) proposed by (CITAR LAWSON HANSON 1974). In other words, we solve a linear system with positivity constraint at each $k$th iteration given by the equation 

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{p}^k = \left(\mathbf{G}_{p}^{(k)T} \mathbf{G}_{p}^{(k)}\right)^{-1} \mathbf{G}_{p}^{(k)T}  \Delta \mathbf{T}^o
	\label{eq:linsys_p}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{G}_p^{(k)}$ is the magnetic-moment sensitivity matrix at the $k$th iteration. The elements of this matrix are composed by derivative of equation \ref{eq:tfa_pred_pos_i} in relation of $j$th element of the vector $\mathbf{p}^k$.

After estimating the magnetic-moment distribution $\mathbf{p}^k$ at the $k$th iteration using the previous estimate $\mathbf{q}_{k-1}$ for the magnetization direction, we estimate a new vector $\mathbf{q}^{k}$ by solving an unconstrained nonlinear inverse problem of minimizing the squared Euclidean norm of the difference between the observed and predicted total-field anomalies. In this nonlinear inversion we use the Levenberg-Marquardt method (CITAR ASTER). That is, we calculate at each $k$th iteration the step $\Delta \mathbf{q}^k$ for the magnetization direction by using the equation

\begin{equation}
	\Delta \mathbf{q}^k = (\mathbf{G}_{q}^{(k)T} \mathbf{G}_{q}^{(k)} + \lambda \mathbf{I})^{-1} \mathbf{G}_{q}^{(k)T}  \mathbf{r}^k
	\label{eq:linsys_q}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is the Marquardt parameter that is updated along the iterative process, $\mathbf{I}$ is a indentity matrix, and  the residual at the $k$th iteration $r^k = \Delta \mathbf{T}^o - \mathbf{\Delta T} (\mathbf{p}^k, \mathbf{q}^{k-1})$. $\mathbf{G}_q^k$ is a sensitivity matrix of the magnetization direction part, whose elements are composed by derivative of equation \ref{eq:tfa_pred_pos_i} in relation of each component of the vector $\mathbf{q}^k$, that are the inclination and declination, respectively. The iterative process stops when the squared Euclidean norm of the difference between the observed data $\Delta \mathbf{T}^{o}$ and predicted data $\Delta\mathbf{T}(\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{q})$ (equation \ref{eq:tfa_pred}) is invariant along succesive iterations (Figure \ref{fig:scheme_LM_NNLS}).



%However, we have to apply successive corrections $\Delta \mathbf{q}^k$ for calculating the magnetization direction vector $\mathbf{q}^k$ at each $k$th iteration. It is calculated using the Levenberg-Marquardt method (\cite{aster2005}), that is given by equation   
%
%\begin{equation}
%	\Delta \mathbf{q}^k = (\mathbf{G}_{q}^{kT} \mathbf{G}_{q}^k + \lambda \mathbf{I})^{-1} \mathbf{G}_{q}^{kT}  \mathbf{r}^k
%	\label{eq:linsys_q}
%\end{equation}
%where $\mathbf{G}_q^k$ is the sensitivity matrix of the part of magnetization direction of equivalent sources at the $k$th iteration, $\lambda$ is the Marquardt parameter that is update along the iterative process and $\mathbf{I}$ is a indentity matrix. The elements of the matrix $\mathbf{G}_q^k$ are composed by derivative of equation \ref{eq:tfa_pred_pos_i} in relation of each component of the magnetization direction vector $\mathbf{q}^k$, that are the inclination and declination, respectively. The correction is given by
%
%\begin{equation}
%	\mathbf{q}^{k+1} = \mathbf{q}^k + \Delta\mathbf{q}^k,
%	\label{eq:q_correction}
%\end{equation}
%and residual $\mathbf{r}^k$ is equal to 
%
%\begin{equation}
%	\mathbf{r}^k = \Delta \mathbf{T^o} -  \Delta \mathbf{T} (\mathbf{p}^k, \mathbf{q}^k).
%	\label{eq:residual_k}
%\end{equation}
%The iterative process stops when the data-misfit function (equation \ref{eq:misfit}) is invariant along succesive iterations according a stop criterion.
