# Figures and Latex source files for the manuscript

This folder contains the figures and [Latex](https://www.latex-project.org/)
sources for the paper.

The main file of the text is in `eqlayer_magdir_manuscript.tex`, references are handled by bibtex and
stored in `references.bib`, and the `makefile` has the commands for building
the PDF (using the build automation tool
[make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software))).

We recommend using *make* to build the PDF because it handles the file
dependencies. This way, the PDF in only regenerated if any of the source or
figure files change.

The figures are often generated by the code in `code` folder.
Numerical values like data values, computation times, etc that are included in
the paper text are set in the `.tex` files by the code as well.
This guarantees that these values are up-to-date with the current figures and
results.
