We have developed a new method for estimating the total magnetization direction of magnetic sources based on equivalent layer technique using total field anomaly data. In this approach, we do not have to impose a strong information about the shape and the depth of the sources, and do not require a regularly spaced data. Usually, this technique is used for processing potential data estimating a 2D magnetic moment distribution over a ficticious layer composed by dipoles below the observation plane. In certain conditions, when the magnetization direction of equivalent sources is almost the same of true body, the estimated magnetic property over the layer is all positve. The methodology uses a positivity constraint to estimate a set of magnetic moment over the layer and a magnetization direction of the layer through a iterative process. Mathematically, the algorithm solve a least squares problem in two steps: the first one solve a linear problem for estimating a magnetic moment and the second solve a non-linear problem for magnetization direction of the layer. We test the methodology applying to synthetic data for a complicated scenarios and geometries of sources. Moreover, we applied the method to field data from Goias Alkaline Province (GAP), center of Brazil, over Montes Claros complex. The result suggests the area is composed by intrusions with remarkable strong remanent magnetization component, being in agreement with the current literature for this region.
