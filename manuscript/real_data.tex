\label{sec:real_application}

The Goias alkaline province (GAP) is a region in the central part of Brazil that there are occurences of mafic-ultramafic alkaline magmatism. This region presents a variety of rocks with an extense petrographic types. Throughout the area there are mafic-ultramafic complexes (plutonic intrusions), subvolcaninc alkaline intrusions (diatremes) and volcanic products (kamafugite lava flows) with several dikes. Some of the main alkaline complexes of GAP are: the Montes Claros de Goi\'as, Diorama, Corrego dos Bois, Morro do Macaco and Fazenda Buriti. These alkaline intrusions are sorrounded by a Precambrian basement and the Phanerozoic sedimentary rocks of the Paran\'a Basin. \citep{junqueira_brod_2005,carlson_etal_2007,marangoni_mantovani_2013,dutra_etal_2014}. Recent studies indicate the existence of a remarkable remanent magnetization component within these intrusions \citep{marangoni_mantovani_2013,oliveirajr_etal_2015,marangoni_etal_2016,zhang_etal_2018}. 

The aeromagnetic survey has a flight pattern with north-south spaced from $\sim 500$ m and $ \sim 8$ m along each line, and a constant height of $100$ m from the terrain. The geomagnetic field direction for this area was $-19.5^\circ$ and $-18.5^\circ$ for inclination and declination, respectively. We invert the total-field anomaly (Figure \ref{fig:mc_data_application}a) from the alkaline complex of Montes Claros. To speed up data processing and inversion, we downsampled the data along the flight lines, resulting a grid of $55 \times 32$ points (a total of $N=1787$ observations). This new set up results an approximately $320$ m and $470$ m grid spacing along the x- and y-axes, respectively. We use an equivalent layer composed by a grid of $55 \times 32$ dipoles (a total of $M=1787$ equivalent sources) positioned at a depth of $840$ m below the observation plane ($\sim 2$ times the greater grid spacing). The algorithm starts with an initial guess of $-70^\circ$ and $50^\circ$ for the inclination and declination, respectively. Figure \ref{fig:mc_data_application}b shows the predicted data produced by equivalent layer. Figure \ref{fig:mc_data_application}c shows the residuals defined as the difference between the observed data (Figure \ref{fig:mc_data_application}a) and the predicted data (Figure \ref{fig:mc_data_application}b). Notice that, two small places in Figure \ref{fig:mc_data_application}d where large residuals are clearly apparent may indicate the existence of shallow-seated geological sources with different magnetization direction. However, the histogram of residuals (Figure \ref{fig:mc_data_application}d) is acceptable with its mean of $-14.52$ nT ($\sim 0.1\% $ of the maximum value of total-field anomaly data) and standard deviation of $312.28$ nT ($\sim 2 \% $ of the maximum value of total-field anomaly data). The estimated magnetization direction $\bar{\mathbf{q}}$ has inclination $-50.2^\circ$ and declination $34.9^\circ$. Figure \ref{fig:mc_data_application}e and \ref{fig:mc_data_application}f shows the estimated magnetic-moment distribution $\bar{\mathbf{p}}$ and the convergence of the algorithm. We check the quality of the estimated magnetization direction by computing the reduction-to-pole of the observed total-field anomaly. We can notice that the RTP field anomaly (Figure \ref{fig:rtp_mc_data}) exhibits predominantly positive values and decays to zero towards the borders of study area. For this reason, we consider that the estimated magnetization direction led to a satisfactory RTP anomaly. We conclude with these results that the all-positive magnetic moment distribution and the estimated magnetization direction produce an acceptable data fitting. The estimated magnetization direction also confirms the existence of remarkable remanent magnetization.
