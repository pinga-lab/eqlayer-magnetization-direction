We present a novel methodology for estimating the magnetization direction of geological sources
using equivalent-layer technique. Moreover, we prove the existence of an equivalent layer having 
an all-positive magnetic-moment distribution for the case in which the magnetization direction of this 
layer is the same as that of the true sources.

## Abstract

It is known from potential theory that a continuous and planar layer of dipoles 
can exactly reproduce the total-field anomaly produced by arbitrary 3D sources. 
We prove the existence of an equivalent layer having an all-positive 
magnetic-moment distribution for the case in which the magnetization direction 
of this layer is the same as that of the true sources, regardless of whether the 
magnetization of the true sources is purely induced or not. 
By using this generalized positivity constraint, we present a new iterative method 
for estimating the total magnetization direction of 3D magnetic sources based on 
the equivalent-layer technique. Our method does not impose a priori information 
either about the shape or depth of the sources, does not require regularly spaced 
data, and presumes that the sources have a uniform magnetization direction. 
At each iteration, our method performs two steps. The first one solves a 
constrained linear inverse problem to estimate a positive magnetic-moment 
distribution over a discrete equivalent layer of dipoles. We consider that the 
equivalent sources are located on a plane and have an uniform and fixed 
magnetization direction. In the second step we use the estimated magnetic-moment 
distribution and solve a nonlinear inverse problem for estimating a new 
magnetization direction for the dipoles. The algorithm stops when the equivalent 
layer yields a total-field anomaly that fits the observed data. 
Tests with synthetic data simulating different geological scenarios show that 
the final estimated magnetization direction is close to the true one. 
We apply our method to a field data from the Goi√°s Alkaline Province (GAP), 
over the Montes Claros complex, center of Brazil. The results suggest the presence 
of intrusions with remarkable remanent magnetization, in agreement with the current 
literature for this region.

### Setting up your environment and dependencies

You'll need a working Python **2.7** environment with all the standard
scientific packages installed (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, etc).  The easiest
(and recommended) way to get this is to download and install the
[Anaconda Python distribution](http://continuum.io/downloads#all).
Make sure you get the **Python 2.7** version.

We use `conda` virtual environments to manage the project dependencies in
isolation. Thus, you can install our dependencies without causing conflicts with your
setup (even with different Python versions).

Run the following command in the repository folder (where `environment.yml`
is located) to create a separate environment and install all required
dependencies in it:

    conda env create

You'll also need to install version 0.5 of the
[Fatiando a Terra](http://www.fatiando.org/) library.
See the install instructions on the website.
